# Wikipedia Dark Themes
### In development!

### Installation:
1. Create an account or login to Wikipedia (or use an script injector extension).
2. (Optional) Edit the ```:root``` elements of wikipedia.css to the values you want, it's intuitive, easy and quick.
3. On Wikipedia go to Preferences > Appearance > Skin > Vector (make sure it's selected) > Custom CSS > Edit page (or something similar), paste and save the contents of wikipedia.css.
  
That's it. üëç  

### Why?
I was browsing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and saw a trending submission that intrigued me, a Wikipedia modern UI redesign, since I can't set the Dark Reader extension in a way I enjoy and I spend a good amount of time on Wikipedia, I tried it out, it was gorgeours to look at but it was unecessarily dificult to do anything beside reading the article, and for no good reason it was a closed source Browser extension, it made me respect even more Wikipedia's default desktop theme, it's perfectly simple, everything is in your sight and you can see every option clearly, I can change the article's language in one click without thinking or having to browse a menu.   
  
Summarizing the rest, I searched for themes here on Github and most need an extension, are hard to edit, or are a completely unecessary redesign that priorizes UI over UX, so here it is, if you want to use this repo and even read through this **totally unecessary explanation**, you probably saved a lot more time than you would spend tinkering with other themes.
